      dependencies:
      ### pip install -U scikit-learn
      ### pip install matplotlib

In this file a set of data (data.csv) is at hand to train a model and a set of test data (test.csv) is available to test the trained model
In this assignment, an attemp is made to use linear regression and three SVR (support vector regression) methods (linear, poly and rbf) to train the model and predict the outcome.
In order to reduce the time of compiling, only the svr_rbf method is uncommented, but the rest work perfectly fine if they are removed from comments.
in order to calculate the error threshhold of the trained model, the last row for the show is designated for testing the margin of error, which is printed at the bottom.
